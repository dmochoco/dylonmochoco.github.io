									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>UNLV CS Senior<br />
									Looking to make meaningful contributions in the tech industry.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/dylonochoco_headshot.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I'm Dylon, a fourth year Computer Science major at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. From a young age, I've always enjoyed the process of building something 
									and watching it come to completion. This is why I chose to study Computer Science, I believed that I would have a natural affinity toward coding. 
									My experience at UNLV has taught me a lot like coding fundamentals and object-oriented programming. In addition to that, I also had the opportunity to help teach a classroom
									of about 90 students to develop WinForms programs using C#!  Although my time at UNLV is reaching
									its conclusion, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of what kind of person I want to be and what this broad field has to offer. 
									I hope that this website gives you an idea of what kind of person I am as well as a showcase a portion of my skillset, thanks for visiting! <br />
								</p>
								<header class="major">
									<p>A little more about me if you're curious...</p>
								</header>
								<p>A lot of the other past work experience I have done is extremely detail-oriented. Most recently, I worked at 888 Collectibles, a well known trading card and collectibles store
									in the collecting community. A big hobby of mine has always been collecting, so I jumped at the chance at an opportunity to work there. My position there was as a card specialist,
									this entailed being able to appraise and accurately price collectibles, making important decisions alone to help generate revenue for the store, and of course building rapport with the TCG (trading card game) community.  
									It's hard being able to describe such a unique position but, it was a job I was very fond of and a team I enjoyed working with very much. In addition to that,
									I worked with the United States Bowling Congress at the 2021 and 2022 USBC Open Championships where over 46,000 competitors both professional and casual
									would attend. I worked in their Bowler Services department where I helped write over 320 bulletins based on the different bowlers that would attend on that day as well as their accomplishments.
									This was a position where being able to collaborate with colleagues and finishing things before deadlines was crucial. I met a lot of great people at this position and it helped me build a good
									work environment etiquette. 
									<br />
									<br />
									In my time at UNLV I was also the Treasurer for the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) chapter. In 2022 our chapter helped host that years 
									annual West Regional Conference <a href="https://www.unlvsase.org/">(WRC)</a>. 
									Our event united chapters, let students explores diverse career paths, and collaborated with the Asian Community Resource 
									Center to support Asian American integration, education, and economic development.
									I also grew our chapter's total revenue by 90% by securing additional funding and strategic financial management, which enabled the ability to sponsor conferences benefiting STEM students in their academic and career endeavors
